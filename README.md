The main purpose of the mobile application is to integrate with a mocked endpoint which gives a json file that contains a list of cities.
Cities have a list of malls asociated with them along with shops at those Malls.
The Mobile app after initial load,displays a list of Cities and giving the use an ability to select a city from the list.
Selected city will give a list of malls found at that city ,and again a mall selection gives a list of shops at found at the mall selected.
